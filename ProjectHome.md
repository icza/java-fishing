## Description ##
Fishing is a 2D skill game. You can see the level from the side, which has 2 parts: water and air divided by the water surface. Your task is to control a boat floating on the surface, and catch as many fish as you can. You can move the boat horizontally – left/right on the surface, and you can move your fishing net vertically – up/down. The fishes comes from both left and right, and they swim through the scene. Once a fish leaves the scene it’s considered as a “missed fish”. Game ends when you miss 10 fishes.

As time goes by during the game, catching fishes will get more and more difficult: fishes get faster, more fish can swim through the scene at a time, the waves of the surface and their drifting effect grow bigger and bigger.

You can move the boat and the net with the cursor keys, and you can pause the game at any time with the space. By pressing F1 you get a little help.
